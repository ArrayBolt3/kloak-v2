# Kloak v2 - Keyboard and Mouse Biometrics Scrambler

Reimplementation of kloak, with better mouse anonymization and input handling.
Specifically designed for use with Wayland.

VERY work-in-progress. Right now all this does is display some crosshairs on
the screen that follow the mouse, it only works with one screen, it only works
in virtual machines (or maybe other machines with a "touchscreen" interface),
and it isn't very robust against things like addition or removal of input
devices or displays. Most or all of these shortcomings will be dealt with as
this is developed, and eventually the actual cloaking features (input jitter
in keyboard and mouse usage patterns) will be added. Stay tuned!
